- **Use Cases**: Development, testing, small teams

### 2. Kubernetes with Helm
Ideal for production environments requiring high availability and scalability.
- **Pros**: Auto-scaling, high availability, enterprise-grade
- **Cons**: More complex setup, requires Kubernetes knowledge
- **Use Cases**: Production environments, large teams, enterprise deployments

### 3. Manual Installation
For custom environments or specific infrastructure requirements.
- **Pros**: Maximum flexibility and control
- **Cons**: More setup work, manual configuration
- **Use Cases**: Custom infrastructure, air-gapped environments

## Architecture Overview

Terrateam Self-Hosted consists of several key components:

- **Terrateam Server**: Main application handling webhooks and orchestrating Terraform operations
