This page answers the most frequently asked questions about Terrateam Self-Hosted deployment, configuration, and operation.

## General Questions

### What is Terrateam Self-Hosted?

Terrateam Self-Hosted is the private, on-premises deployment option for Terrateam that allows you to run the platform on your own infrastructure. This gives you complete control over your data, security, and compliance while maintaining all the features of Terrateam.

### How does Terrateam Self-Hosted differ from Terrateam Cloud?

| Feature | Terrateam Cloud | Terrateam Self-Hosted |
|---------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **Hosting** | Managed by Terrateam | Self-managed |
| **Data Location** | Terrateam's infrastructure | Your infrastructure |
| **Maintenance** | Handled by Terrateam | Your responsibility |
| **Scalability** | Automatic | Manual configuration |
| **Compliance** | SOC2, varies by region | Meets your requirements |
| **Cost** | Usage-based pricing | Infrastructure + license costs |

### What are the system requirements?

**Minimum Requirements:**
- 2 CPU cores, 4GB RAM
- PostgreSQL 14+
- Docker runtime
- 20GB storage

**Recommended for Production:**
- 4+ CPU cores, 8GB+ RAM
- External managed PostgreSQL
- Load balancer for high availability
- 100GB+ storage with backups

### Which deployment method should I choose?

- **Docker Compose**: Best for development, testing, and small teams
- **Kubernetes**: Ideal for production environments requiring scalability and high availability
- **Manual Installation**: Choose when you need maximum control or have custom infrastructure requirements

## Installation and Setup

### How do I create a GitHub Application for Terrateam?

1. Clone the Terrateam repository
2. Run the setup container: `GH_ORG=YOUR_ORG docker-compose up setup`
3. Navigate to http://localhost:3000 and follow the setup wizard
4. Save the generated configuration file

For detailed steps, see the [Getting Started Guide](/self-hosted/getting-started/).

### Can I use an existing PostgreSQL database?

Yes! You can use any PostgreSQL 14+ database. Create a dedicated database and user for Terrateam:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE terrateam;
CREATE USER terrateam WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'secure_password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE terrateam TO terrateam;
ALTER DATABASE terrateam OWNER TO terrateam;
```

### How do I update Terrateam Self-Hosted?

**Docker Compose:**
```bash
docker-compose pull
docker-compose up -d
```

**Kubernetes:**
```bash
helm repo update
helm upgrade terrateam terrateamio/terrateam
```

**Manual:**
```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/terrateamio/terrat-oss:latest
docker stop terrateam-server
docker rm terrateam-server
# Restart with new image
```

## GitHub Integration

### How does Terrateam Self-Hosted interact with my source code?

Terrateam never stores or clones your source code repositories. Instead, it uses the GitHub API to:
- Read file contents when needed
- Create pull request comments
- Update commit statuses
- Manage workflow runs

All source code remains in your GitHub repositories.

### Does Terrateam work with GitHub Enterprise Server?

Yes! Set these environment variables for GitHub Enterprise Server:

```bash
export GITHUB_API_BASE_URL="https://api.github.example.com"
export GITHUB_WEB_BASE_URL="https://github.example.com"
```

### Can I use Terrateam with multiple GitHub organizations?

A single Terrateam Self-Hosted instance supports multiple repositories within one GitHub organization. For multiple organizations, you'll need:
- Separate GitHub Applications for each organization, or
- Multiple Terrateam Self-Hosted instances

### How do I handle webhook delivery failures?

1. **Check webhook URL accessibility** from GitHub's servers
2. **Verify webhook secret** matches your configuration
3. **Review GitHub App settings** for correct webhook URL
4. **Check firewall rules** to allow GitHub webhook IPs
5. **Monitor application logs** for webhook processing errors

## Security and Compliance

### How secure is Terrateam Self-Hosted?

Terrateam Self-Hosted provides enterprise-grade security:
- All GitHub communication uses HTTPS with webhook signature verification
- Database connections are encrypted
- No source code storage or persistence
- Audit logging for all operations
- Support for custom TLS certificates and proxy configurations

### What data does Terrateam store?

Terrateam stores:
- **Terraform plans and state metadata** (not the actual state files)
- **Pull request information** (titles, numbers, commit SHAs)
- **User activity logs** for audit purposes
- **Configuration settings** and environment variables

Terrateam does **NOT** store:
- Source code or repository contents
- Terraform state files
- Sensitive variables or secrets from your infrastructure

### Can I run Terrateam in an air-gapped environment?

Yes, with some considerations:
- GitHub Enterprise Server must be accessible from the Terrateam instance
- Container images must be available (pull and store locally, or use a private registry)
- Configure appropriate proxy settings if needed
- SSL certificate validation may need customization

### How do I implement RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)?

Access control is managed through GitHub:
- **Repository permissions** control who can trigger Terrateam
- **Branch protection rules** control deployment workflows
- **GitHub team memberships** determine access levels
- **Organization settings** provide additional security controls

## Operations and Scaling

### Is Terrateam Self-Hosted horizontally scalable?

Yes! You can run multiple Terrateam server instances as long as they share the same PostgreSQL database. Use a load balancer to distribute traffic across instances.

**Example scaling configuration:**
- 3 Terrateam server instances
- Shared PostgreSQL database
- Load balancer with health checks on `/health`

### How do I backup Terrateam Self-Hosted?

**Database Backup:**
```bash
pg_dump -h $DB_HOST -U terrateam terrateam > terrateam_backup.sql
```

**Configuration Backup:**
- Environment variables and secrets
- GitHub App credentials
- SSL certificates and keys
- Load balancer/proxy configurations

**Automated Backup Example:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
DATE=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
pg_dump -h $DB_HOST -U terrateam terrateam > "terrateam_backup_$DATE.sql"
# Upload to secure storage location
```

### How do I monitor Terrateam Self-Hosted?

**Health Monitoring:**
- Monitor `/health` endpoint
- Set up alerts for application downtime
- Monitor database connectivity

**Resource Monitoring:**
- CPU and memory usage
- Database performance metrics
- Disk space utilization

**Application Monitoring:**
- Webhook processing success rates
- GitHub API rate limits
- Terraform operation durations

### What's the recommended backup strategy?

1. **Daily database backups** with point-in-time recovery
2. **Configuration backups** stored securely
3. **Test restore procedures** regularly
4. **Monitor backup integrity** and retention policies
5. **Document recovery procedures** for your team

## Troubleshooting

### Why isn't Terrateam responding to pull requests?

Common causes:
1. **Webhook delivery failures** - Check GitHub App webhook settings
2. **GitHub App not installed** - Verify installation on repositories
3. **Workflow file missing** - Ensure `.github/workflows/terrateam.yml` exists
4. **Permissions issues** - Check GitHub App permissions
5. **Server errors** - Review application logs

### How do I debug webhook issues?

1. **Check GitHub webhook deliveries** in App settings
2. **Test webhook endpoint** manually: `curl https://your-domain.com/api/github/v1/events`
3. **Verify webhook secret** matches configuration
4. **Review server logs** for webhook processing errors
5. **Check firewall/proxy** settings

### Why are Terraform operations slow?

Potential causes:
- **Resource constraints** - Insufficient CPU/memory
- **Database performance** - Slow queries or connections
- **Network latency** - Slow GitHub API responses
- **Large Terraform configurations** - Consider breaking into smaller modules

### How do I handle certificate issues?

For custom or self-signed certificates:

```bash
# Skip certificate verification for specific hosts
export NO_VERIFY_TLS_CERT="internal.example.com"
export NO_VERIFY_TLS_NAME="internal.example.com"
```

For proper certificate chain configuration:
```bash
# Ensure full certificate chain
cat cert.pem intermediate.pem > fullchain.pem
```
