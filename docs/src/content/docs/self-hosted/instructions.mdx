import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Terrateam Self-Hosted is the private, on-premises deployment option for running Terrateam in your own infrastructure. This guide covers installation using Kubernetes or a manual setup process.

To deploy Terrateam with Docker Compose, refer to our [GitHub README](https://github.com/terrateamio/terrateam).

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
- Docker
- Docker Compose

:::note
Terrateam Docker images are built for `linux/amd64`.
:::

## Step 1: Create a Private Terrateam GitHub Application
Terrateam Self-Hosted requires a new Terrateam GitHub application to be created.

1\. Clone the `terrateamio/terrateam` repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/terrateamio/terrateam.git
   cd terrateam/docker/terrat
   ```
2\. Start the `setup` container:
   :::danger[IMPORTANT]
   Set the `GH_ORG` environment variable to the name of your GitHub organization where you want to install Terrateam. If you're setting this up for your personal GitHub account, you can use your GitHub username, as it also acts as your default organization.
   :::
   ```sh
   GH_ORG=YOUR_GITHUB_ORG docker-compose up setup
   ```
3\. Navigate to http://localhost:3000 and follow the setup instructions.
   :::danger[IMPORTANT]
   Save your GitHub application settings file to a safe place. You'll need it for the next step.
   :::

## Step 2: Deploy the Terrateam Server
Choose one of the following deployment methods based on your requirements and infrastructure setup:

### Kubernetes
1\. Source your private Terrateam GitHub application settings file:
   ```sh
   source ./dotenv
   ```
2\. Create your Terrateam private GitHub application secrets:
   ```sh
   kubectl create secret generic terrateam-github-app-pem --from-literal=pem="$GITHUB_APP_PEM"
   kubectl create secret generic terrateam-github-webhook-secret --from-literal=secret="$GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET"
   kubectl create secret generic terrateam-github-app-client-secret --from-literal=secret="$GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_SECRET"
   kubectl create secret generic terrateam-github-app-client-id --from-literal=id="$GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_ID"
   kubectl create secret generic terrateam-github-app-id --from-literal=id="$GITHUB_APP_ID"
   ```
3\. Create your Terrateam database password secret:
   ```sh
   kubectl create secret generic terrateam-db-password --from-literal=password="STRONG_PASSWORD_HERE"
   ```
4\. Add the Terrateam Helm repository:
   ```sh
   helm repo add terrateamio https://terrateamio.github.io/helm-charts/
   helm repo update
   ```
5\. Install the Helm chart based on your specific setup:
   ###### GKE with an HTTPS load balancer and managed certificate
     \- Create a global static IP address:
        ```sh
        gcloud compute addresses create terrateam-static-ip --global
        ```
     \- Show the IP:
        ```sh
        gcloud compute addresses describe terrateam-static-ip --global
        ```
     \- Add the global static IP to a DNS zone you control, for example, as `terrateam.example.com`

     \- Install the Helm chart:
        ```sh
        helm install terrateam terrateamio/terrateam \
        --set terrateam.config.fqdn="terrateam.example.com" \
        --set ingress.certificate.enabled="true" \
        --set ingress.enabled="true" \
        --set ingress.annotations."networking\.gke\.io\/managed-certificates"="terrateam-ingress-certificate" \
        --set ingress.annotations."kubernetes\.io\/ingress\.global-static-ip-name"="terrateam-static-ip" \
        --set ingress.annotations."kubernetes\.io\/ingress\.class"="gce" \
        --set-string ingress.annotations."kubernetes\.io\/ingress\.allow-http"="false"
        ```

        **Using Google-managed SSL certificates with Ingress can take up to 60 minutes to configure. The Ingress can be in a ready state while the certificate is still in the provisioning state.**

   ###### Without Ingress
     ```sh
     helm install terrateam terrateamio/terrateam --set server.dns_name="terrateam.example.com"
     ```
     You can use [NGINX-ingress](https://cert-manager.io/docs/tutorials/acme/nginx-ingress/) and [cert-manager](https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager) to expose the `terrateam-server` service.

   ###### Custom
     Specify a custom `my-values.yaml` for installation:
        ```sh
        helm inspect values terrateamio/terrateam > my-values.yaml
        helm install -f my-values.yaml terrateam terrateamio/terrateam
        ```
6\. When the Terrateam server starts up, it will try to update the GitHub application Webhook URL using the Helm chart value `server.dns_name`, which in turn populates the `TERRAT_API_BASE` environment variable. To disable, set the `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_URL_UPDATE` environment variable to `FALSE`.

### Manual Instructions
#### Components
Terrateam consists of two components:
- Terrateam server [ghcr.io/terrateamio/terrat-oss:latest](https://github.com/orgs/terrateamio/packages/container/package/terrateam)
- PostgreSQL database (at least v14)

#### PostgreSQL Database

Create the Terrateam user
```sql
CREATE USER terrateam WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'terrateam';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE terrateam TO terrateam;
GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA public TO terrateam;
ALTER DATABASE terrateam OWNER TO terrateam;
```

#### Environment Variables
Set the environment variables in the Terrateam server container, see [Environment Variables](#environment-variables-1).

#### Docker Run
```sh
docker run \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -e DB_HOST="db" \
  -e DB_USER="terrateam" \
  -e DB_PASS="terrateam" \
  -e DB_NAME="terrateam" \
  -e GITHUB_APP_ID="1" \
  -e GITHUB_APP_PEM="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\nMIIEowIBAAsYd4c7nM/N\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n" \
  -e GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET="02d87878a0ac61d75d25cz8fec1d1af509f9a6d9" \
  -e GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_ID="Iv1.8ea942184ee41c0b" \
  -e GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_SECRET="8dab6d1de78a2cdbc9o014dubcf4a55ca44a3c81" \
  -e TERRAT_API_BASE="https://terrateam-public-endpoint.example.com/api" \
  -e TERRAT_WEB_BASE_URL="https://terrateam-public-endpoint.example.com"
  ghcr.io/terrateamio/terrat-oss:latest
```

#### Webhook URL
When the Terrateam server starts up, it will try to update the GitHub application Webhook URL
using the `TERRAT_API_BASE` environment variable. To disable, set the `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_URL_UPDATE`
environment variable to `FALSE`.

:::note
If you set the GitHub Webhook URL manually, make sure you
include a trailing `/api/github/v1/events`.
:::

## Step 3: Install the Terrateam GitHub Application

1\. Navigate to the GitHub application settings page for your Terrateam GitHub application.

2\. Click "Install App" and select the repositories you want to use with Terrateam.

3\. Click "Install" to complete the installation.

## Step 4: Start Using Terrateam

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues during the installation process, refer to the following troubleshooting tips:
- Ensure that your Terrateam server is running and accessible from the internet.
- Double-check that your GitHub application settings are correct and match the values in your Terrateam server environment variables.
- Verify that your database connection string is correct and that the Terrateam user has the necessary permissions.
- Check the logs of your Terrateam server for any error messages or warnings.
- Make sure you've installed your private GitHub application after the Terrateam server is successfully up and running.

If you're still having trouble, reach out to the Terrateam support team or community for assistance.

## Frequently Asked Questions
### How Does Terrateam Self-Hosted Interact with My Source Code?
Terrateam never stores source code and never clones repositories. Terrateam uses the GitHub API
to retrieve source code and interact with the repository.

### Does the Terrateam Server Work with GitHub Enterprise Server?
Yes. To use Terrateam with GitHub Enterprise Server, set the following
environment variables:

```
GITHUB_API_BASE_URL
GITHUB_WEB_BASE_URL
```

### Is the Terrateam Server Horizontally Scalable?
Yes. Add as many Terrateam servers as you want as long as they're all pointing
to the same database.
